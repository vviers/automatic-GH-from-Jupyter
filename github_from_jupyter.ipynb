    "[Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) are one of my favorite tools for data science. They help you conduct a complete data analysis project by allowing you to contextualize and comment your code with text, equations, figures, etc. In fact, even this blog post has been created by a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "With [GitHub](https://github.com/vviers) being another of the tools I use on a daily basis (to keep track of my code, collaborate with other programmers, or host this blog), it only made sense that I would try and find a way to upload my Jupyter Notebooks to their designated repositories *from within themselves*. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this may not seem like a huge gain of time, it can actually be very useful for notebooks that are regularly re-run (e.g. using data that change daily) so that it is automatically updated on GitHub everytime it is run again. \n",
